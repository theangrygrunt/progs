This is my personal repo for proposed changes to CTF mode

Changes:

CTF capture time is now instantaneous when you get within range (currently 30 will change to 10 or 15).

Upon taking the flag some buffs and debuffs will be applied:
1. Player movement will be capped to 530 units. This will prevent defraggers from chain-capping flags
2. Player will receive a "shield" of 25 units of armor that will continuously regenerate to 25 units until one of the following happens:
  1.  Player is killed
  2. Player drops the flag voluntarily
  3. Player captures the flag
3. Normal armor rules still apply, and collected armor will not be regenerated

Notes:
Gamemode is called ctfgrunt in the game mode selection menu.
